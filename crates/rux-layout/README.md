# rux-layout

Rux layout: a styled node tree fed through `taffy` to produce absolute paint
rects.

Boxes come straight from taffy's flexbox and grid implementation. Text leaves
are sized through a `measure` callback the caller supplies, which is what keeps
this crate free of any font dependency: the shell owns the text engine, and
layout only needs an answer about how big a string comes out. The output is a
flat list of paint items in absolute coordinates, ready for `rux-paint`.

## Internal to Rux

This is one crate of the [Rux](https://ruxlang.dev) workspace. It is published
so the toolchain builds from crates.io, not as a library to depend on: it makes
no stability promise of its own and its API moves whenever the runtime needs it
to. The supported entry point is
[`ruxlang`](https://crates.io/crates/ruxlang).

```bash
cargo install ruxlang     # installs a `rux` command
rux run app.rux
```
