# rux-ir

The typed IR of Rux's script language: what a file means once the type
checker has worked out every type, with every name resolved and every
conversion written in. Rux's interpreter runs it, and Rust generation for
release builds reads it. It also holds the type language the checker uses.

This is step 4 of the move off rhai described in `docs/11-next.md`. It
depends on nothing else in the workspace, and on no rhai.

## Internal to Rux

This is one crate of the [Rux](https://ruxlang.dev) workspace. It is published
so the toolchain builds from crates.io, not as a library to depend on: it makes
no stability promise of its own and its API moves whenever the runtime needs it
to. The supported entry point is
[`ruxlang`](https://crates.io/crates/ruxlang).

```bash
cargo install ruxlang     # installs a `rux` command
rux run app.rux
```
