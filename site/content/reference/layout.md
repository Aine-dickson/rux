- **Everything defaults to `display: block`.** Block containers make children fill.
- **Use `display: flex` for layout.** Flex cross-axis defaults to **flex-start**
  (children hug), not CSS's `stretch`, which is a deliberate divergence for ergonomics.
- **Hug means `fit-content`**: a box with no `width` is clamped to its parent's
  inner width, so it can't burst out of a narrower parent. An explicit `width` (or
  `flex-shrink: 0`) is your call and *will* overflow, so clip it with `overflow: hidden`.
- `display: grid` works (`grid-template-columns` / `-rows`: `1fr`, `px`, `auto`).
- No inline text flow: two `<text>` siblings **stack**, they don't share a line.
- **Lengths are logical pixels.** Layout and taps run in logical space and the
  scene is scaled to the display's DPI, so `16px` is the same physical size on a
  1x and a 2x screen.
