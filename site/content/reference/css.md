**Selectors:** tag, `.class`, `#id`, `[role="…"]`, compounds, and all four
combinators: descendant (`.a .b`), child (`.a > .b`), next-sibling (`.a + .b`),
subsequent-sibling (`.a ~ .b`).

**Pseudo-classes:** `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:checked`, `:current` (a
link whose `to` names the path you are on), and `:enter-from` / `:leave-to`
(the two sides of an enter/leave swap, below). They stack
(`.btn:hover:active`), count as class-level specificity, and work anywhere in a
chain, `.card:hover .title` recolours the title while the pointer is over the
card. `:hover`/`:active` hold for the whole chain under the pointer, as in CSS;
`:active` is press-to-release and drops if you drag off the element; `:focus`
matches the input holding the caret. Driven in `examples/pseudo.rux`.

Any *other* pseudo-class (`:disabled`, `:nth-child(…)`, `::selection`) **never
matches**, and says so once on stderr. Before this existed the `:` was silently
dropped, so `.box:hover` parsed as `.box` and applied *unconditionally*, failing
closed is the safer half of that trade.

**Transitions:** `transition` walks a property to its new value instead of
jumping to it, whatever moved it: a signal, a `:class`, or a pseudo-class.
```css
.card { transition: background-color 200ms ease-out, transform 200ms ease-out; }
.card:hover { background: #45475a; transform: translateY(-4px); }

.panel { height: 0; opacity: 0; transition: all 250ms ease-in-out 50ms; }
.panel.open { height: 60px; opacity: 1; }
```
Each entry is a property, a duration, an easing and a delay, in any order after
the property. As in CSS the **first** time is the duration and the second is the
delay, `all` stands for every animatable property, and a bare `transition: 200ms`
means `all 200ms`. Easings: `linear`, `ease` (the default), `ease-in`,
`ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, `cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. `steps()` is not
supported.

**Animatable:** `opacity`, `background-color`, `color`, `border-color`,
`border-width`, `border-radius`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `gap`,
`font-size`, `transform`, the insets (`top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left`, which
animate together), and on a `<path>`: `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke-width` and `d`,
the geometry itself. Naming anything else warns and lists what is animatable,
rather than leaving you with an element that silently never moves. A longhand of
an animatable shorthand (`padding-left`) is pointed at the shorthand: the four
sides animate as a unit.

Three limits, all of them deliberate:
- **A value that has no midpoint jumps.** `10px` → `50%` needs a layout to
  resolve, and a colour becoming a gradient has no halfway. Same-unit lengths
  interpolate; anything else lands at once.
- **Enter and leave are opt-in.** Unmarked, a node still arrives at its
  authored style and a node the build stops reaching is simply gone. Add
  `r-transition` to animate the way in and out; see below.
- **`transition` does not inherit**, exactly as in CSS. A parent's `color`
  change does not animate a child's text; put the transition on the element
  whose style is moving.

An app with no transitions running is still fully event-driven: it sleeps
waiting for real events and renders nothing. Frames are scheduled only while
something is actually in flight, and stop the frame it lands. Driven in
`examples/transition.rux`.

**Enter and leave:** `r-transition` on an element with `r-if` (or on a keyed
`r-for` row) says that its arrival and departure are animated. What the two
sides look like is CSS, on `:enter-from` and `:leave-to`; how long the swap
lasts is the element's own `transition`.
```rux
<view class="panel" r-if="open" r-transition>…</view>
```
```css
.panel { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0px);
         transition: opacity 300ms ease-out, transform 300ms ease-out; }
.panel:enter-from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(-16px); }
.panel:leave-to   { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(-16px); }
```
The two sides are ordinary rules and the walk between them is the same
machinery a `:hover` uses. `:enter-from` is worn for one frame and dropped by
the next, which is what turns an arrival into an ordinary style change;
`:leave-to` is held from the moment the swap opens until it commits.

While a swap is pending **both branches are really there**: laid out, styled,
and still updating. That is why the condition changing back mid-swap reverses
the swap instead of stacking a second one, and why a departing component's
`unmounted` fires when the swap **commits** rather than when it starts. A
cancelled swap never fired one.
